Notes from Dennis

If we are doing some sort of wait for incoming message -> push to concurrent queue, have to be wary of that write blocking,
otherwise we can get backed up on the Netty side, which is bad. Two solutions to this
1. Have multiple internal queues
2. Have the concurrent queue be unbounded
I prefer the latter one, because nsqd can manage some of the bookkeeping of how many messages to send. This means, however,
that we won't be able to efficiently determine the length of the queue (if it is linked list backed), so we may need to 
maintain an external counter, which is fine.

Dennis also counsels that I look into using Callable instead of Runnable... That will return a Future that we can act on.
I don't think I want that, because I want whoever submitted that task to be able to move on. Only catch is that I do need to know
which connection that message came from.
